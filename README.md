# EventBaseCollision
In this repo, I implement the event based collision simulation. Based on [Simulating an Ideal Gas to Verify Statistical Mechanics](http://stanford.edu/~jeffjar/files/simulating-ideal-gas.pdf) written by Jeffrey Chang, we try to simulate particles which is constrained in 2d box, and collide with each other. From thermal physics, we may expect the velocity will reach Bolzmann-Maxwell distribution at the thermodynamic limit.
